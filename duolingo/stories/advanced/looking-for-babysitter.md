Dear Eddy,
Thank you for using Instant Babysitters. We have many qualified professionals to care for your son, Junior.
Here are the profiles of 3 babysitters who live in your area:
Option 1: Liz

I'm Liz. I have 10 years of babysitting experienceâ€¦ OK, that's not true.I only have 1 year of experience, but it felt like 10!That was the year I was forced to babysit my little sister.
People often describe my behavior as "immature" and "childlike," but I think that helps me relate to my younger clients.
Option 2: Justin

What's up? I'm Justin. The best thing about me as a babysitter is that I'm able to teach your kids how to be independent.
It'll be like I'm not even there (because I might not be).
While some parents complain that I'm not actually watching their children, I think my "hands-off" approach will help your kids become self-reliant.
One child complimented my babysitting style by saying, "It was like I was totally alone."That's why kids call me the "invisible babysitter."
Option 3: Jess

My name is Jess, and I'm a fantastic cook.Kids love my food!My culinary specialties include anything that doesn't involve a stove, an oven, or a knife.
But in the case of kitchen emergencies, I do have the number of the local fire department memorized.They even know me by name!
Please let me know which babysitter you'd like to hire to care for your son!
Sincerely, Danny Customer Service Instant Babysitters
